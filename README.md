# 🚀 Overview

Hello there 🧙.
This is just my little playground — a personal pet project where I get to mess around, test cool stuff, and build a hub for apps I actually use.
Tried the open project route, but... yeah, doesn’t give me a 100% perfect solution.
So here we go — time to build things my way! 🛠️💥🛠️
